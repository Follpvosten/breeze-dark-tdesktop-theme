# breeze-dark-tdesktop-theme
A telegram desktop theme based on the Breeze Dark color scheme.  
Based on some other theme i found a long time ago, and my attempt at fixing
that one (correcting colors and such).  
In theory, you could download a zip file of the source code, rename the file
extension to `.tdesktop-theme` and then apply that to Telegram, but don't quote
me on this.
